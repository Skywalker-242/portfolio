- B.S., Computer Science | The University of Ibadan (February 2021 till date)

## Work Experience
**Data Science Intern @ Training, Research and Development Institute,University of Ibadan (_June 2023 - Present_)**
-I had the unique opportunity to contribute to a cutting-edge project focused on detecting fake reviews within online platforms. Throughout my internship, I was actively involved in every phase of the project, from data collection to model implementation. This role provided me with valuable hands-on experience in the field of data analysis, machine learning, and cybersecurity.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
